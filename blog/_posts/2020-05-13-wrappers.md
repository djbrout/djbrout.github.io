Why using wrappers can help you ship code better and faster in data science.

## Productionizing data science code

Data science projects today tend to use lots of open source libraries because they are an effective in producing prototypes.

After you build a prototype, the next question is: how do I productionize it?

As a data scientist, I want my code to be easy to productionize and start creating value as soon as possible. This means there are a few patterns I can use in my code to speed things up for everyone, including myself. Here's one pattern that I've seen great success: use wrappers.

## Why wrappers

One may ask: why do you want to wrap a library with your own function? Isn't it doing the same thing? Looks like waste of time to me.

Short answer: no, it's not a waste of time.

## An example 

Here's an example. Let's say I'm building a computer vision project and I need to load images. I have several libraries that I can use

* `Pillow`: `Image.open()`
* `opencv`: `cv2.imread()` 
* `matplotlib`: `matplotlib.pyplot.imread()`

Let's say I decide to go with `Pillow`. A pattern that I saw in online tutorials is that the author would take a object coming from an external library and plug it straight into their code:

```py
# model.py
from PIL import Image 

def my_model_1(path):
    image = Image.open(path)
    # do something to image...

def my_model_2():
    image = Image.open(path)
    # do something to image...
```

This innocuous piece of code creates a problem: You are locked into `Pillow`'s implementation of loading image:

If I want to implement a new method for `Image` that's not part of Pillow, I'm in trouble. I've seen people spending time debating on

    * whether switching to another library, say `opencv` is better, or
    * whether to override the native `PIL.Image` method by forking it into a company repo,

etc. None of them are as good as using a wrapper because of the downstream maintenance cost they incur.

If the class `PIL.Image` ended up being used in 100 places, then the switching cost to another library is a code change in 100 places. The risk of breaking production code is too high.

## What I would do with wrapper

Let's go back to the image reading example. Let's examine how different those 3 libraries read images.

* [Jupyter Notebook for this piece of code](/notebook/2020-05-13-wrappers/read-image.ipynb)

This is the image I'm going to use:

![Nyan cat](/figure/source/2020-05-13-wrappers/nyancat.png)

I want to read pixel `(108, 223)`, which is the pink blush on the cat's cheek. Here's what the three libraries represent this single pixel as numpy arrays:

and they are all different ðŸ˜±!!

```
# Pillow uses RGB format
pillow_array[108, 223, :]
>>> array([  0,  53, 106], dtype=uint8)

# OpenCV uses BGR format
opencv_array[108, 223, :]
>>> array([106,  53,   0], dtype=uint8)

# Matplotlib is RGB scaled between 0 and 1
matplotlib_array[108, 223, :]
>>> array([0. , 0.20784314, 0.41568628], dtype=float32)
```

Imagine that you are an engineer and want to convert a data scientist's code from using `matplotlib` to read images to using `Pillow`, how many places you would need to change and check that it's not breaking the code?

This is only a single `.png` file. There are other image formats like `.jpg`, `.webp` and colorscales that make this problem even moer complicated in reality.

## Making wrappers 

This is where wrappers come in handy if I remembered to use it before I let an external library into my code.

For example, I can define my own class called `MyImage` that wraps around `PIL.Image`:

```py
# utils.py 
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

class MyImage:

    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        # ... however you want it

    @classmethod
    def read(cls, path):
        with Image.open(path) as image:
            return cls(data=np.asarray(image.convert('RGB')))
```

and in our original code:

```py
from my_project.utils import MyImage

def my_model_1():
    # ...
    image = MyImage.read('something')
    # do something to image...

def my_model_2():
    # ...
    image = MyImage.read('something')
    # do something to image 
```

that's it. Now I can change the internals of `MyImage`, say an attribute `.channel`, to track whether it is `BGR` or `RGB` to feed into models in `opencv`. 

This time, the `Pillow` library only has a single contact point with my code. If production requires using a different library, we only need to change and test a single place â€” the interface `MyImage`.

This also makes testing easy because the wrapper hid the complex `PIL.Image` object and only show the methods and attributes that we care about. Mocking `MyImage` is much easier than mocking `PIL.Image`.


## Why is this better again?

Let me say again why this is a good idea:

1. You only need to change one place if you want to replace a library
2. It is easier to test because it is easier to mock.

In my experience, 1 saves a lot of time for project handoffs. For example, 

* In deep learning libraries, the one group of data scientist uses `DataLoader()` from PyTorch but another group uses `Dataset` in Tensorflow.
* In JavaScript, the one team uses `axios` for making API calls but another team wants to use `.fetch()`.

Data I/O code tend to scatter all over the codebase and the large footprint makes it hard to factor if a new need arises. In other words, it is technical debt.

## When not to wrap

What are some places that you may _not_ want a wrapper, even if it is a third party library?

I think for common data formats, there is no need to make a wrapper for it.

For example,

* `numpy.array`
* `pandas.DataFrame`

are everywhere in a data science project. They are essential data formats for modules to communicate with each other. Wrapping around them cause more trouble than gain.

*This is fine*

## Takeaways

When you write new code that uses a function or a class from an external library, think about what you actually need from it and write a wrapper around said function or class.

This makes change in the future easier and reduce technical debt for handoff between teams.
