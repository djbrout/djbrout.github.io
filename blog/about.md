### Chang Hsin Lee 李常新

![profile-pic](/figure/source/profile.jpg)

Born and raised in Taiwan, I have landed at Albuquerque, Nashville, Tampa, and Charlotte. I'm a data scientist by trade, and a baseball fan by heart. This blog is for my long thoughts. The short ones are on [@ChangLeeTW](https://twitter.com/ChangLeeTW).

### Speaking

I speak at conferences and meetups. You can find [a sample of the talks I gave in here](https://changhsinlee.com/speaking/).

### Contact me

You can reach me by tweeting at [@ChangLeeTW](https://twitter.com/ChangLeeTW). You can also send an email to lee.changhsin (Gmail account).

### My Newsletter

Summary of posts and new ideas I am experimenting that goes out about once a month. Get in the loop here:
