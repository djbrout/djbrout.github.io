I found causal modeling hard to get into after reading Pearl's book, so I started collecting resources. 

This list is updated whenever I find something new. They are not what I recommend unless specified because I may have not used it. 

If you have not heard of causal modeling, I recommend starting with Judea Pearl's popular science book [The Book of Why](https://amzn.to/2KntAg8).
