In PyderPuffGirl Episode 1, I showed you how to open a SQL query in Python. How can I submit said query through Python to a database? Moreover, how can I get the result of the query as a file in Python?

## Goal

In this episode, I will show you how to submit a SQL script and save the results to files.

This is what I think a typical query workflow looks like:

1. Put the query into a proprietary SQL software
2. Press a button to run the query
3. Wait indefinitely
4. Get the result back, with the option of saving it as a file.

I will show you how to skip 1-3 and go directly to 4 in Python. Well, I still need to wait indefinitely, but the general steps are:

1. read the SQL script into Python
2. connect to database and run the script
3. save the result as a .csv file in a specific path

Although I'm demonstrating on Windows 10, I added steps for Mac and Linux too. If you are a Mac user, please let me know if you find something missing.

## I. Let's install Python packages

### Must

You will need to install two Python packages to follow the tutorial:

* `pandas`
* `sqlalchemy`

To install, run

```sh
pip install --user pandas sqlalchemy
```

in a command line tool like `cmd` in Windows or Terminal in Mac.

### Optional‚Äîdepends on the database

You also need to install the corresponding database plugin. In this example, I used PostgreSQL, so the Python package is

* `psycopg2`

I will put the list of drivers I know at the bottom of this page.

If you figured out the correct package and steps for a database that I did not list, please contribute in the comments‚Äîwith database name and versions specified‚Äîand I will update the list with proper credits.

## II. Setting the username and password in environment variable

Before connecting to a database, let's set my database username and password as _environment variables_. [If you are interested, you can read more about what they are in here.](https://superuser.com/questions/284342/what-are-path-and-other-environment-variables-and-how-can-i-set-or-use-them)

### Wait, why do I want to use environment variables?

Unless I want to type my username and password for every query, they have to _live_ somewhere on the computer. So, I have several options:

#### Option 1. Just put my password inside the Python script

I've put my password into the script, then forgotten about it and pushed my passwords to a central code repository before. That means I can see my password on a public webpage. Oof.

üí©üëé _Please learn from my blunder and don't do this._

Fun exercise: If you can search through the content a central code repository, try searching for "password" or "pw" and see what shows up.

#### Option 2. Put my password in an environment variable

Anything that is in a user's environment variables can only be accessed by the said user (me) and the admin. Therefore, the only way to access my database username and password is to get hold of the login password to the computer or the server first. It's safer.

üòäüëç _This is the preferred option._

Editing environment variable for user account should not pop a local admin rights warning. If you work a corporate job and somehow this option is blocked by IT, then maybe Option 3 is the way to go.

#### Option 3. Putting my password in a separate configuration file

As long as the config file does not go to the central code repository I think this is ok. Setting environment variables, however, means that we don't need to put the path of the config file into our code. Managing file path is boring, so I'd rather not deal with it.

### How to set environment variables

The example I use here is PostgreSQL. For that, I am going to call my username and password environment variables `PSQL_USERNAME` and `PSQL_PASSWORD`. You can call them whatever you want. The naming convention for environment variables is all capitalized letters with no space.

For example, let's say my

* username is `chang`, and
* password is `CreativePassword`

#### On Windows

On Windows 10, type `edit environment variable` in the search bar. Click "Edit environment variables for your account."

![](/figure/source/2018-12-03-pyderpuffgirls-ep2/edit-environment.png)

Then, in the popup window, click `New...` and put in the variable name and value.

Remember to press `OK` at the bottom of the popup window "Environment Variables" to save!

![](/figure/source/2018-12-03-pyderpuffgirls-ep2/edit-environment2.gif)

The steps for Windows 7 are slightly different from 10. [This page might help](https://web.archive.org/web/20150729183638/http://www.itechtalk.com/thread3595.html). If you can't access that site, [use this one](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml).

#### On Mac or on Linux or on remote Unix server

Go to the user home directory and look for the file `.bash_profile`. To add a environment variable in Unix, I can modify `.bash_profile` by adding commands with the general pattern of

```
export [name_of_variable]=[new_value]
```

So in this case, I can open `.bash_profile` with a text editor, add two lines

```
export PSQL_USERNAME=chang
export PSQL_PASSWORD=CreativePassword
```

and save the file. After saving, run the following command in terminal to refresh the environment variables:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Putting those two lines in `.bash_profile` means the environment variables will load each time I log into this user account.

## III. Connect to a database and run queries

### Example: connecting to a PostgreSQL database

Here is the code that I'm going to explain in this section.

```py
import os
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

username = os.environ['PSQL_USERNAME']
password = os.environ['PSQL_PASSWORD']

engine = create_engine(f'''postgresql+psycopg2://{username}:{password}@localhost:5432/mydb''')

query = '''
select *
from weather
'''

df = pd.read_sql_query(query, engine)
df.to_csv('weather.csv', index=False)
df.to_csv(Path('c:/users/chang/documents/weather.csv'), index=False)
```

In this example, I am going to use a local (on my computer) PostgreSQL database `mydb` with only one table `weather` of two rows. If you are using a different database at work, then you need to figure out the connection string by yourself.

![](/figure/source/2018-12-03-pyderpuffgirls-ep2/psql-weather-table.png)

### Driver and connection URL

Before I can start, I need to get two things‚Äî

* Driver
* Connection URL

that are specific to the database at hand.

This is why I had to install the Python package `psycopg2`. It serves as the database driver and SQLAlchemy does not know how to connect to my PostgreSQL database without it.

The best way to figure out which driver and connection URL to use is...Google. Most of the time, I'd google something like

```
How to connect to Redshift with sqlalchemy
```

and replace Redshift with whatever database you are working with. You can also try googling

```
How to connect to [databasename] python
Python driver for [databasename]
...etc
```

Most of the time, the correct connection URL can also be found in the proprietary SQL tool that you use to query a database. The driver is trickier, and I don't have a good method other than googling.

If you have trouble finding the right driver and connection URL for work in less than 30 minutes, talk to the DBA. They are the expert. Don't spend too much time on this when it's one ask away!

### 1. Figure out which driver to use

This is how I found the PostgreSQL plugin for `sqlalchemy`

![](/figure/source/2018-12-03-pyderpuffgirls-ep2/search-driver.png)

Turns out the first answer in StackOverflow was what I needed‚Äîit tells me to install the `psycopg2` package from `pip`. So, I can install through command line by running

```sh
pip install --user psycopg2
```

This one wasn't too bad, but there were times when I couldn't find the correct drivers to use after several hours. I should have known better and asked the DBAs or data engineers.

**Note:** `SQLAlchemy` uses an ODBC connection. I intentionally leave out JDBC connection in the post because I think it will be better to put JDBC into another supplemental post. [Here is a quick Explain Like I'm 5 post from Reddit about ODBC and JDBC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/7vg10w/eli5_difference_between_odbc_jdbc_oci_ole_db/).

### 2. Figure out the right connection URL

Again, I resorted to googling. I searched for

![](/figure/source/2018-12-03-pyderpuffgirls-ep2/search-connection-url.png)

Inside the first link, [it showed me an example](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#database-urls) where the general connection URL looked like

```
dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database
```

For PostgreSQL, I can use a connection URL like

```py
engine = create_engine('postgresql+psycopg2://scott:tiger@localhost/mydatabase')
```

Now I just need to figure out the right `hostname` and `port`. Again, the fastest way to find out about those at work is to talk to a DBA or a data engineer.

In this case, because I'm using a local version of PostgreSQL that uses port 5432, I can use the following connection URL:

```py
engine = create_engine(f'''postgresql+psycopg2://{username}:{password}@localhost:5432/mydb''')
```

(The f-prefix means it is a Python 3.6 format string. [Please refer to Episode 1](https://changhsinlee.com/pyderpuffgirls-ep1/).)

Th database settings part ends here. I can finally start connecting.

### 3. Connect to the database with username and password

The username and password are still missing in the f-string:

```py
engine = create_engine(f'''postgresql+psycopg2://{username}:{password}@localhost:5432/mydb''')
```

So the next step is getting my username and password from the environment variable. The Python module `os` comes in handy.

```py
import os

username = os.environ['PSQL_USERNAME']
password = os.environ['PSQL_PASSWORD']
```

By giving `os.environ` the name of an environment variable (passed into the square brackets as string), `os.environ` returns the corresponding value we set before into `username` and `password`, which are then substituted into the f-string.

You will see more examples like this later where I "passing a string to get a value back." In this aspect, `os.environ` resembles a Python data type `dict`‚Äî the dictionary. This kind of relationship is often called a _key-value pair_.

### 4. Write a SQL query, submit,  and return a pandas dataframe

Let's use a super simple query to demonstrate. The table I'm going to pull is called `weather` with only two rows, and I'm selecting all of them:

```py
query = '''
select *
from weather
'''
```

Then, I can use the `read_sql_query` function of `pandas` to submit the query through the `sqlalchemy` engine defined earlier.

```py
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, engine)  
```

* `import pandas as pd` means we are using `pd` as an alias of `pandas`. This kind of abbreviation is quite common for Python modules.
* Once imported as `pd`, the line `pd.read_sql_query` tells Python to use `read_sql_query` from the module `pd` = `pandas`.

Running `df` prints out

![](/figure/source/2018-12-03-pyderpuffgirls-ep2/running-query.gif)

#### What if I submit multiple queries separated by semicolons?

If I run

```py
q3 = '''
select * from weather
where prcp < 0.5;
select 'hello' as world;
'''
pd.read_sql_query(q3, engine)
```

Then it only returns and prints out the final query.

Note that because I didn‚Äôt assign the return value of `read_sql_query` to a variable, it prints the result to screen as a pandas dataframe:

![](/figure/source/2018-12-03-pyderpuffgirls-ep2/query3.png)

Here's a small trick that only works in Jupyter notebook. In Jupyter notebook, what is last printed to the screen is actually saved to a variable with the name of a single underscore `_`. So if I forget to assign a variable name for a long-running job, I still have a chance to save it. This doesn't work in a normal Python script though, and please don't use it in production jobs.

![](/figure/source/2018-12-03-pyderpuffgirls-ep2/last-result.gif)

### 5. Save the dataframe as a .csv

Finally, Ie will save the result as a csv. Because I load the query result into a pandas dataframe, I can use the dataframe method `.to_csv()` to save the result to file.

```py
# path 1, relative path
df.to_csv('weather.csv', index=False)

# path 2, absolute path
from pathlib import Path
df.to_csv(Path('c:/users/chang/documents/weather.csv'), index=False)
```

There are two ways to tell Python where the file is:

* **relative path**: Path 1, `weather.csv`, uses the relative path from the current working directory. To find out what the current working directory is, I can run the following code:

    ```py
    import os
    os.getcwd()
    ```
    It says the current working directory is `D:\\pyderpuffgirls\\lesson2`, the folder where I put my notebook in. I will talk more about relative paths later when I go into Python scripts.
* **absolute path**: in Windows, if the path starts with the drive name like `c:` or `d:`, and in Mac/Linux, if the path starts with `/` like `/usr/chang/file/some_file.csv`, then they are absolute paths.

    This means `to_csv()` will save the file to the place I specified, independent of what the current working directory is.

What about that `index=False` thing? By default, `to_csv()` will also save the index of the dataframe as its own column

![index column](/figure/source/2018-12-03-pyderpuffgirls-ep2/df-index.png)

which I don't need.

Here's what the `.csv` file I saved looks like in Notepad++:

![saved file](/figure/source/2018-12-03-pyderpuffgirls-ep2/saved-file.png)

### Bonus: Write dataframe back to the database

(Jared Cline suggested adding this section to make the post complete. Thanks Jared!)

Other than writing the result to a file, sometime I want to load the dataframe back to a custom table in the database. In this case, I can use the `.to_sql()` method. Let's say I have a dataframe called `food`,

```py
food = pd.DataFrame({
    'date': ['2018-01-01', '2018-01-02', '2018-01-03'],
    'dinner': ['taco', 'taco', 'burrito']
})
food['date'] = pd.to_datetime(food['date'])  # change the data type from string to datetime
```

![food dataframe](/figure/source/2018-12-03-pyderpuffgirls-ep2/food.png)

then I can load it into my PostgreSQL database by

```py
food.to_sql('dinner', engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)
```

which will save the dataframe as a table called `dinner`.

![dinner table](/figure/source/2018-12-03-pyderpuffgirls-ep2/upload-database.png)

You can find the options for `.to_sql()` [in the pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.to_sql.html).

### Bonus: Replacing query by a SQL script file

[In Episode 1](https://changhsinlee.com/pyderpuffgirls-ep1/), I show how to read a file into Python as a string. This means that if I have a file called `weather-query.sql`, then I can replace the part where it says

```py
query = '''
select *
from weather
'''
```

by reading in the file

```py
with open('weather-query.sql') as file:
    query = file.read()
```

before I submit the query.

## Summary

Let's look at the code again:

```py
import os
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path

username = os.environ['PSQL_USERNAME']
password = os.environ['PSQL_PASSWORD']

engine = create_engine(f'''postgresql+psycopg2://{username}:{password}@localhost:5432/mydb''')

query = '''
select *
from weather
'''

df = pd.read_sql_query(query, engine)
df.to_csv('weather.csv', index=False)
df.to_csv(Path('c:/users/chang/documents/weather.csv'), index=False)
```

Now you know how to

1. Read the SQL script into Python
2. Connect to database and run the script
3. Save the result as a .csv file in a specific path

I'd like to think that this workflow highlights a common pattern about developing Python scripts: there are many packages out there that can do stuff for you. In particular, I used

* `sqlalchemy`‚Äîthat let me connect to the Postgres database, and
* `psycopg2`‚Äîthat provided the driver to `sqlalchemy`, and
* `pandas`‚Äîthat let me run a query through `sqlalchemy` and save to file.

## What's next?

I didn't realize how long this post was going to be when I started. But we are here!

So far, I have been using Jupyter notebooks to run my code. In the next post, I will talk about what is a Python script and how to schedule a Python script. It is fine to run code in Jupyter notebooks, but I tend to use them only as scratch pads.

Putting Python code into scripts has several benefits:

* They are easier to work with version control‚ÄîJupyter is horrible for this
* They have better logging
* They are better for packaging and distributing
* I can unlock the power of an IDE‚Äîlike PyCharm‚Äîwhen editing. Always [unlock the swag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3w00n8Rs-k).

But I won't cover all the benefits yet. There are still two annoying pieces that I need to automate away: scheduling and emailing.

## Appendix A: some common errors

When you see an error‚Äî

* Take a deep breath.
* Don't panic.
* _Scroll to the bottom_.

### ModuleNotFoundError

This often means I don't have the correct driver installed. For example, if I run a MySQL URL,

```py
connect_string = f'''mysql://{username}:{password}@localhost:5432/mydb'''
engine = create_engine(connect_string)
```

then Python complains:

![](/figure/source/2018-12-03-pyderpuffgirls-ep2/errors/module-not-found1.png)

Scrolling to the bottom, the error message tells me that a package `MySQLdb` is missing:

![](/figure/source/2018-12-03-pyderpuffgirls-ep2/errors/module-not-found2.png)

Googling "pip sqlalchemy mysqldb" and [the first StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22252397/importerror-no-module-named-mysqldb) tells me that I should go look for the packaged called `PyMySQL` and install it with `pip`.

Most of the time, I'm like WTF this error message is not helpful‚Äîwhy does the error message give me a module name that is different from the actual package name? It is what it is üôÑ.

### OperationalError

This usually means there was something wrong in my connection URL.

#### Cause: wrong hostname or port

When I run

```py
connect_string = f'''postgresql+psycopg2://{username}:{password}@localhost:5678/mydb'''
engine = create_engine(connect_string)
query = '''
select * from weather
'''
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, engine)
```

It throws an `OperationalError` when it gets to `read_sql_query`:

![](/figure/source/2018-12-03-pyderpuffgirls-ep2/errors/operational1.png)

Scrolling to the bottom shows

![](/figure/source/2018-12-03-pyderpuffgirls-ep2/errors/operational2.png)

The error shows up because the port I'm running the local Postgres on is `5432`, but my connection URL says `5678`.

#### Cause: wrong password

This is what happens when I put in the wrong password:

![](/figure/source/2018-12-03-pyderpuffgirls-ep2/errors/operational3.png)

### ProgrammingError

One reason for a `ProgrammingError` is an invalid query. For example, This is what happens when I forget to add the group by clause when I'm taking the mean of a column:

```py
avg_query = '''
select city, avg(prcp) as avg_prcp
from weather
'''
df_avg = pd.read_sql_query(avg_query, engine)
```

It throws a `ProgrammingError` and tells me I should add `city` to the group by clause i.e. `group by city;`. I believe the error message you see in `ProgrammingError` are not universal and depends on the database.

![](/figure/source/2018-12-03-pyderpuffgirls-ep2/errors/programming.png)


## Appendix B: about `pip`

### Making sure `pip` works

*this section is a work in progress.*

If you are on Windows, it's possible your `python` and `pip` command won't work after installing Python. I am going to dump most of the installation into a master post later.

### Always google before install

Always google `pip [package name]` before installing a Python package via `pip`. The name of package on GitHub may not be the same name used on PyPI (the pip repository) when you install. The correct name is the one on the PyPI page.

 [There are incidents of criminals putting impersonating package names in PyPI](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ten-malicious-libraries-found-on-pypi-python-package-index/), so they can plant malware via pip install typos. As long as you check before installing, however, `pip` is safe to use.

For example, SQLAlchemy has

* A PyPI page: [https://pypi.org/project/SQLAlchemy/](https://pypi.org/project/SQLAlchemy/)
* A project homepage: [https://www.sqlalchemy.org/](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)

so it's legit. Install with `pip install SQLAlchemy` (not case sensitive) according to the PyPI page.

## Appendix C: connection driver and URLs

Please help by making this list complete. If you can let me know what works for you in the comments, then I can update this list.

### PostgreSQL

* Driver: [psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/)
* Connection URL: `postgresql+psycopg2://{username}:{password}@{hostname}/{databasename}`
    [The example was found here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#postgresql).

### Teradata

1. Teradatasqlalchemy (Official)

    Not sure if you can specify the database or not.

    * Driver: [Teradatasqlalchemy](https://pypi.org/project/teradatasqlalchemy/)
    * Connection URL: `teradatasql://{username}:{password}@{hostname}`

2. SQLAlchemy-Teradata (Unofficial)

    This driver is pre-release, but it works.

    * Driver: [sqlalchemy-teradata](https://pypi.org/project/sqlalchemy-teradata/)
    * Connection URL: `teradata://{username}:{password}@{hostname}`
